# CMP408-LKM-Keylogger
A Linux Kernel Module (LKM) Keylogger for U.K USB Keyboards on a Raspberry Pi Zero W

This Keylogger was made for my university module CMP408 IOT project. In the send function you will see turning on and off an LED. If you wish to use the code, this can be removed as this was just to fulfil the requiremnts of my assignment. Unless you plan on flashing LEDs of course :)!

To find keyboard scancodes I ran the command 

sudo showkey --scancodes
